# Image-classification 
Here, I present two different categories of machine learning models for image classification. The directory 'Without Neural Networks' consists of three types of image classifiers: K-Nearest Neighbors classifier, Multiclass Support Vector Machine classifier, and a Softmax classifier.<br>
On the other hand the directory 'With Neural Networks' consists of neural network based implementations for the same image classification task.
